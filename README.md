# Boredbot

This is a Scrimba project. __BoredBot__ is the first project in Module 9 (Working with APIs) of Scrimba's Frontend Developer's Path. The main focus of this project is using the `fetch` API to get data from an external API and then chaining `.then` actions to the response, converting the fetched API response to JSON and rendering it.
